# Saga Pattern 
step-by-step guide to implementing a Saga pattern in Java

Step 1: Define the services involved in the Saga

First, you need to define the services involved in the Saga. For this example, let's consider a simple Saga involving three services: Service A, Service B, and Service C.

Step 2: Implement the Saga orchestrator

Next, you need to implement the Saga orchestrator, which is responsible for coordinating the execution of the Saga. Here is a simple example of a Saga orchestrator in Java:

public class SagaOrchestrator {
    
    public void executeSaga() {
        try {
            // Step 1: Call Service A
            ServiceA serviceA = new ServiceA();
            serviceA.execute();
            
            // Step 2: Call Service B
            ServiceB serviceB = new ServiceB();
            serviceB.execute();
            
            // Step 3: Call Service C
            ServiceC serviceC = new ServiceC();
            serviceC.execute();
            
            // If all services executed successfully, commit the Saga
            // Otherwise, rollback the Saga
        } catch (Exception e) {
            // Handle exception and rollback the Saga
        }
    }
}


Step 3: Implement the individual services

Next, you need to implement the individual services involved in the Saga. Here is an example of how you can implement Service A, Service B, and Service C:


public class ServiceA {
    
    public void execute() {
        // Implement service logic for Service A
    }
}

public class ServiceB {
    
    public void execute() {
        // Implement service logic for Service B
    }
}

public class ServiceC {
    
    public void execute() {
        // Implement service logic for Service C
    }
}



Step 4: Test the Saga

Finally, you can test the Saga by creating an instance of the Saga orchestrator and calling the executeSaga() method:


public class Main {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SagaOrchestrator orchestrator = new SagaOrchestrator();
        orchestrator.executeSaga();
    }
}

This is a basic example of how you can implement a Saga pattern in Java. You can further enhance this implementation by adding compensation logic for each service in case of failure, implementing timeouts, and handling retries.
